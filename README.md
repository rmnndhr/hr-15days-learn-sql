### Challenge Title
15 Days of Learning SQL

### Challenge Problem
Julia conducted a 15 days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least 1 submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.

### Files used
- HR_15DaysofLearningSQL.sql
- hackers.csv
- submissions.csv
>**Note**: The .csv files aren't included in the repository. I created tables hackers and submissions based on the sample input provided in the Challenge.

>**Note**: Current program only checks for 6 days instead of 15 days since the sample input only has 6 days worth of data. More refactoring is needed to check for 15 days without having to create table views for each day.

### Program versions used
- pgAdmin 4 Version 6.21
